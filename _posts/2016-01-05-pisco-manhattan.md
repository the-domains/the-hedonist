It's a brilliant idea. Remake classic cocktails like the Manhattan with pisco as the base spirit instead of whiskey. The first time I was introduced to this concept I was drinking in New York's amazing Peruvian restaurant / pisco bar, Raymi. They've got the best pisco collection I've seen anywhere outside of Peru. The head bartender introduced me to a Pisco Negroni, which turned out to be the best version of a Negroni I've ever had. If this pisco twist on the manhattan is half as good as the Negroni, then we're in for a treat. 

**The Recipe**

* 1.5oz Peruvian Pisco 
* 1.5oz Sweet Vermouth (I'm using Dolin De Chambery Rouge.) 
* 3 dashes Angostura Bitters 
* Orange Peel 
* Fabbri Amarena cherries

Pour the pisco and sweet vermouth into a glass full of ice and toss in the three dashes of angostura bitters. Stir vigorously and strain into a pre-chilled glass. I like to garnish with an orange peel, squeezing the oils into the drink, and then drop in a high-quality brandied cherry.  I've gotten in the habit of making my own brandied cherries. I take Fabbri Amarena cherries, strained out the syrup, then put the cherries in a jar with brandy, sweet vermouth, and chartreuse. They pack a great final punch on your last sip of this fantastic cocktail.
